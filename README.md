This repository contains the material for the practical session of the school Big Data and Machine Learning for Chemistry (BDML4Chem).

It cointains 4 jupyter notebooks:

-   **0_introduction_to_notebook.ipynb**: Quick introduction of how jupyter notebooks work 
-   **1_basic_ML_tutorial.ipynb**: Demonstration of how to use the most common ML python packages to perform a quick analysis of the Boston Housing Dataset.
-   **2_chemical_example.ipynb**: Replication of the same methods using a real world example with chemical data.
-   **3_atomistic_modelling.ipynb**: Introduction to the QML and ASE packages to perform molecular structure analysis and structure-to-property ML models.

The workspace can be launched on Deepnote by clicking on the badge above. 

Deepnote is a new kind of data science notebook. Jupyter-compatible with real-time collaboration and easy deployment.
